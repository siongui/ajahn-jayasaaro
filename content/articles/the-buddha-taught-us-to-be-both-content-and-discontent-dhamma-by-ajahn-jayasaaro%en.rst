The Buddha taught us to be both content and discontent. He taught us to be
content with the amount and quality of material possessions that best support
our practice of Dhamma. We should not allow the accumulation of wealth to
distract us from our spiritual goals.

At the same time, the Buddha taught us to feel discontent with regard to the
virtuous qualities that we have developed. We should remember that none of them
are fixed in our mind; they can all still decline and disappear. We should keep
pushing onwards in order to take full advantage of this precious human birth.
