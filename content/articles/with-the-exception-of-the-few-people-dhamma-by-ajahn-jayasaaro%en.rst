With the exception of the few people who have developed psychic powers, it is
not possible to know exactly what is going on in anybody else's mind. We can
never truly know another person's mind, even if that person is a member of our
own family. We can guess, infer, empathise - often accurately - but it is not
the same as knowing. Humbly reminding ourselves that we do not truly know
another person's mind is important because it means that we don't take that
person for granted. We don't allow our ideas of who they are to become rigid.
This is compassionate, because it is already difficult for people to make
positive changes in their life. It becomes even more difficult if those around
them hold on to fixed ideas about who they are.
