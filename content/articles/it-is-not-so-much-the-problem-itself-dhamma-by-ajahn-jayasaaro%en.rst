It is not so much the problem itself that disturbs us. It is the not wanting to
have the problem. It is the feeling that “it shouldn't be like this! It's not
fair!” or the child-like cry from the heart: ‘why always me?’ The more we
identify with the thought ‘I don't need this in my life - Go away!’, the worse
it gets. The more we try to drive the problem away, the more we feed it.

If you lose a key under water, the more you grope around blindly in search of
it, the more you muddy the water, and the less likely you are to find the key.
Allow the water to become calm, and then you can look right through it and see
the key clearly.
