If you are being unfairly criticized by someone with unkind intentions towards
you, focus on breathing normally and keeping your mind free from anger and
ill-will.

If you are being fairly criticized by someone with unkind intentions, ignore
those intentions and receive the information with gratitude as providing an
opportunity to remedy mistakes.

If you are being unfairly criticized by someone with kind intentions towards
you, focus on the good intentions behind the hurtful words.

If you are being fairly criticized by someone with kind intentions, then listen
carefully and rejoice that you have such a good friend who is willing to point
out mistakes that you could not see yourself.
