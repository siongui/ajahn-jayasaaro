As Buddhist practitioners we remind ourselves:

"Others may be greedy and selfish, but I will try my best not to add even the
smallest amount to all the greed and selfishness in the world.

Others may be cruel and full of hate and anger, but I will try my best not to
add even the smallest amount to all the cruelty, hatred and anger in the world.

Others may be heedless and confused, but I will try my best not to add even the
smallest amount to all the heedlessness and confusion in the world."

Rather than allowing all the unwholesome things in the world around us to make
us feel fearful and depressed we can use them as an encouragement to goodness.
