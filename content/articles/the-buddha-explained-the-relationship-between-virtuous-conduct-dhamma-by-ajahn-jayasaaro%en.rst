The Buddha explained the relationship between virtuous conduct (sīla) and the
higher stages of the path to liberation as follows:

Virtuous conduct leads to absence of guilt and regret, and this leads to
feelings of well-being, which lead to joy. Joy leads to bliss which leads to
concentration. Concentration provides the condition for knowing and seeing
things in their true light. That clear knowing leads to disenchantment with
defilements, which leads to dispassion, the transcendence of ignorant desires.
That transcendence leads to the knowledge and vision of complete liberation.
