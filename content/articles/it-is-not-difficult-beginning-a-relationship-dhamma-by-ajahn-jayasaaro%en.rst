It is not difficult beginning a relationship; it is difficult sustaining the
commitment to keep nourishing it.

It is not difficult being aware of the beginning of a breath; it is difficult
sustaining the mindfulness to remain with it.

It is not difficult becoming inspired by the Dhamma; it is difficult sustaining
that inspiration through all of life's ups and downs.

It is through working through difficult things with patience, kindness and a
humble heart that we grow in goodness and wisdom.
