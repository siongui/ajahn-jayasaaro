One who looks for sweetness in a sack of chillies will be disappointed. One who
looks for a dropped key in a place that is easy to search, rather than where it
was lost, will not find it.

Impermanent pleasures can never provide the lasting happiness that our heart
desires. Only by learning how to look closely at our body and mind will we find
the key to liberation
