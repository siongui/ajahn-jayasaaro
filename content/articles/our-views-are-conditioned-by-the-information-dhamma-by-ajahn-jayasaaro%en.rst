Our views are conditioned by the information we have access to, and the
processing of that information. Both are subject to distortion. How can we be
sure that our information is correct? Or if it is correct how can we be sure
that it is complete? We cannot. A theory based upon incomplete information may
be completely logical but deeply misleading. How sure can we be that our
processing of information has been efficient and without bias, conscious or
unconscious. Even with a system of checks and balances there is room for error.

Considering the unreliable foundations of our views and beliefs we can become
more humble and wise. Being absolutely convinced that we are right about
something may feel good, but it is both foolish and dangerous. How much
suffering is created in the world today by people who are convinced that they -
and only they - are right?
