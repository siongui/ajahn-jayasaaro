One of the inspiring qualities of wise people is their ability to sense the
appropriate behaviour in different places and different times, with different
groups of people and different individuals. They know when it is the right time
to speak and when it is the right time to listen; when it is the right time to
lead and when to follow; when it is the right time to be active and when to be
passive. The don't always follow their own way like a singer with only one song.
They don't just blindly follow what everyone else is doing. Through the practice
of Dhamma they are able to be both flexible and firm.
The ability to act in harmony with the needs of time and place is undermined by
desires and fears, by anger and prejudice, and by mental confusion. It is
strengthened by mindfulness, clear awareness of context and environment, and by
respect for others
