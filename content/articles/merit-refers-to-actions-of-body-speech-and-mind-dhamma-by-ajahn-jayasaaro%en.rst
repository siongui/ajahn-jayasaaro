Merit (puñña) refers to actions of body, speech and mind that brighten, elevate
and purify the mind. In the short term, meritorious actions make us happy. They
increase the quality of both our inner life, and our relations with those around
us. In the long term, by devoting ourselves to goodness, we create the necessary
kammic conditions for a good rebirth. Most importantly, the mind which loves
goodness and kindness will turn naturally towards the inner peace which is the
fount of liberating wisdom.
