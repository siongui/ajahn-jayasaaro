Many years ago, I was climbing up a mountain stream by stepping and sometimes
jumping from boulder to boulder. At one point, I completely lost my balance on a
slippery boulder. I could easily have been left with broken bones and nobody to
miss me before the next day's almsround. Instead, I found myself on my back in
the stream, almost unhurt. Reviewing what had happened, I realized that my body
had just succeeded in a feat of gymnastics on a level that I could never have
achieved through deliberate effort.

The mind can also attain this same kind of spontaneous athleticism, not through
instinct, but by training. Suddenly, and without warning, we may be faced with a
severe challenge. The next thing we know is that we have emerged from it with
barely a mental scratch. Only in review do we see how the Dhamma has protected
our mind. It is at such moments that the results of our steady practice
manifests. Joyfully we recollect the Buddha's words: “The Dhamma protects those
who practise the Dhamma.
