Last Sunday was the birthday of Mahatmā Gandhi. One of my favourite stories
about him concerns the occasion he climbed aboard an extremely crowded train. As
the train began to leave his friends dragged him inside the train and in doing
so one of his shoes slipped off onto the platform. Immediately, without
thinking, Mahatmā Gandhi threw his other shoe out after it. His remaining shoe
was of no use to him now, and the one on the platform would be of no use to
anyone who found it. At least now one person would have a good pair of shoes.
Without thinking, a well-trained body can perform at a high level through muscle
memory. Similarly, without thinking, a well-trained mind spontaneously responds
to events with wisdom and compassion. At such moments there is no sense of self,
and afterwards there arises a deep appreciation of the beauty of Dhamma
