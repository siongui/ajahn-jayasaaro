If plants start to wither, it means they need to be watered. If life seems
dreary and depressing, it means that the mind needs to be watered.
The mind is watered by goodness. The wish to help others, the practice of
mindfulness and the letting go of attachment to negative thoughts, all help the
mind to flourish.
It is not easy to keep plants well-watered throughout the year.
It is not easy to keep the mind constantly well-watered.
But in both cases - and especially the second - it is truly worth it.
