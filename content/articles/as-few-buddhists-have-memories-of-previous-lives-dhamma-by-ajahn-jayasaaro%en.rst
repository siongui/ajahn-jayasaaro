As few Buddhists have memories of previous lives the teachings on rebirth must,
for most of us, remains a matter of faith. Buddhist faith is humble: we don't
claim that something must necessarily be true simply because we believe it to be
so. We place a reasoned confidence in the Buddha's enlightened knowledge. This
confidence grows by putting all the teachings that we are capable of verifying
to the test of experience. On finding that every single one of them stands up to
that test we conclude that we are able to trust the Buddha in those areas, such
as rebirth, which we are, as yet, unable to prove.
