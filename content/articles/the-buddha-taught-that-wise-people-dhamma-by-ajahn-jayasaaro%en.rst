The Buddha taught that wise people understand what is essential and in life and
what is inessential. They give attention to the essential and spend as little
time as possible on the inessential.

Foolish people, on the other hand, misconceive the essential as inessential and
the inessential as essential. They disparage meditation, for example, as
inessential and a waste of time. They consider the time and money they spend on
trivial pursuits to be necessary to their well-being. The first step on the
Buddha's path to liberation does not begin with a leap of faith. It begins when
we start to ask sincere questions about life: 'What is essential?', 'What is
inessential?'
