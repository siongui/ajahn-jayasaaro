Behind the different forms of craving, lies a basic discontent. We feel that
there is something wrong with the present moment. Sometimes we feel that
something is missing, something that we need to get hold of. At other times we
feel that there is something present that should not be, something that we need
to get rid of. Learning to be content with a meditation object, we learn how to
be content with the present moment. Being content with the present moment, we
see so much of our craving to get and get rid of, simply fall away.
