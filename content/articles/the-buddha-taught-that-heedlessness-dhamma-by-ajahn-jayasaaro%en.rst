The Buddha taught that heedlessness (pamāda) is the path to death, and
heedfulness (appamāda) is the path to the deathless.

Heedfulness is such an important virtue that it the teaching emphasised by the
Buddha in the last words he spoke before he left the world. Heedfulness means
keeping ourself awake to the truths of our body and mind, and of the world
around us. It means not allowing ourself to forget that youth, health and life
itself are unreliable and uncertain. It means not taking anything or anyone for
granted.

In family life, heedfulness means finding the time to take care of the quality
of our most important relationships: being mindful of how we act towards those
we live with, how we speak to them, and how we hold them in our thoughts
