The Buddha taught that the desire to boast or manipulate people's perceptions of
us is a mental defilement. Today, social media has given a huge boost to
boasting. Referring to boasting as 'sharing' does not necessarily mean that it
is no longer boasting. Nor does adding a humble comment to a boast.

Intention is all. If you feel a need to edit a photograph of yourself to take
away skin blemishes, to make you look thinner or more attractive, investigate
the reason why.

Mindfulness does not just mean being in the present moment; it means being aware
of whether our intentions are wholesome or unwholesome. Then making the effort
to abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome.
