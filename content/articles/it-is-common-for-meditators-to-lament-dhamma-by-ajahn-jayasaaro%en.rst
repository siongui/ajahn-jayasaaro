It is common for meditators to lament that when their mind becomes calm it
enters an empty state that feels like a dead end. Their mistake is to assume
that the calm experienced through the absence of words and images in the mind is
a level of samādhi. It must be understood that the indifferent feeling being
experienced is not nothing. It is a something that needs to be recognized for
what it is. Attention should now be placed on the mood, the texture of the mind,
the mental canvas itself on which the world of experience is painted. If there
is even a slight stiffness or dullness in the mind, meditator is still caught in
the realm of the hindrances. A more vigorous effort is needed. Identification
with neutral feeling must be abandoned. Clarity and discrimination of mental
states must be enhanced
