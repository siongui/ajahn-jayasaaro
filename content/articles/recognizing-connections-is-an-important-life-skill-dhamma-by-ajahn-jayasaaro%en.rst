Recognizing connections is an important life skill.

When we perceive ourselves as separate beings, we feel lonely and insecure. Our
mind falls prey to selfishness, arrogance and depression.

When we consider how all beings, without exception, want to be happy and fear
suffering; when we consider that all beings are subject to birth, old age,
sickness and death; when we reflect on all the kindness and support we have
received throughout our life, we discover profound connections.

When we perceive ourselves as connected beings, feelings of gratitude and
empathy arise. Our mind feels stable, it sees more clearly and with greater
compassion.
