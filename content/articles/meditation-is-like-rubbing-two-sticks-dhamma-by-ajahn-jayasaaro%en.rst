Meditation is like rubbing two sticks together to make fire. You need a lot of
patience to be successful, and you need consistency and continuity. Perhaps you
start with great enthusiasm, but that won't last. If when you start to feel
tired or bored or discouraged, please understand that you can't just stop for a
while, for a few days or weeks, and then just carry on. The two sticks will be
cold and you will have to start again.

So even if you only do a little every day, never mind. What is important is that
you don't stop.
