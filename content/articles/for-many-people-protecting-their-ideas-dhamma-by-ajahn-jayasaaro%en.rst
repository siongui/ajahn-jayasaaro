For many people protecting their ideas and beliefs is more important than
putting them to the test of truth. One common strategy for doing this involves
what is called closed loop thinking. This refers to creating a position that
cannot be overturned. For example, some people convince themselves that any
evidence that disproves their belief must be false. It has either been planted
by their enemies or designed by their god as a test of faith. Thus, no unwelcome
evidence is taken seriously. To such people, feeling right means that they are
right.

To a Buddhist, feeling right is just a feeling. Feeling completely convinced is
just a feeling. No feeling is a proof. Only the mind that has been trained to
let go of identification with feelings can know what is true and what is false.
