A visitor to the monastery said to Ajahn Chā, 'They say you are fully
enlightened. Does that mean that you can fly through the air?' Ajahn Chā
replied, 'What has flying got to do with it? Dung beetles can fly.'

Ajahn Chā did not encourage talk about psychic powers. He said it was like
someone looking up into the sky when he would be wiser to keep his attention
on the ground beneath his feet.
