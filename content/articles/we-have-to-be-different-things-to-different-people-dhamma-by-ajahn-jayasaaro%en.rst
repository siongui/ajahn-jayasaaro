We have to be different things to different people - mother, father, brother or
sister; friend, colleague, employer,  employee; we have roles to play as members
of a community and citizens of a country. But all these things that we must be,
occupy only one dimension of life.

In meditation, we develop a very direct relationship with our body and mind. We
learn to access a new dimension of our being, one which is free of the sense of
being anything or anyone. It enriches our perspective on life in the world, just
as a picture of three dimensions exceeds that of two. Without this perspective
we take everything too seriously; with it, we can live our life with sincerity
and integrity, but also with a certain lightness
