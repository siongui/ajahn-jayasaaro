It was February 1976. I was a teenager travelling alone through southern India.
I remember climbing down from a crowded bus after a long dusty journey at the
edge of a large town. It was already dark and I walked through the town looking
for a cheap place to spend the night. As I rounded a corner I heard a voice
shouting out to me. I looked over to see a woman sitting at the side of the road
by and old cooking pot, dishing out lentil soup to her many children. She
insisted that I sat down with them and take a plate of soup and some bread. I
was very hungry and the simple food tasted delicious. When I looked up, I saw
the woman was watching my enjoyment with a look of genuine affection and
satisfaction on her face, as if she had just fed her own grown-up son rather
than a stranger.
Almost forty years have passed by. There must have been times on my travels when
I was treated unkindly but I can't remember them now. The kindness of people
like this poor woman however, living in rags on the street with her children,
has never left me. Please do not underestimate small acts of kindness. They have
a power and an influence and a beauty that lasts for a very long time.
