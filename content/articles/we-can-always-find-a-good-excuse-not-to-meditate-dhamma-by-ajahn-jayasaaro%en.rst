We can always find a good excuse not to meditate. It's too early or it's too
late. We're too hungry or too full. We're too tired or too restless. We're too
busy or we just want to relax.

But meditation does not have to yield a particular result to be worthwhile. Our
practice becomes strong through steady, consistent effort, rather than through
rare peak experiences. It is the sincerity, the trying, that is important. When
the mind starts to produce its usual excuses, we can tell ourselves, ‘Yes,
conditions are not ideal, but I will meditate, at least for a short time,
anyway. I will make this effort as an offering to the Buddha, Dhamma and
Sangha.’ And sometimes, having overcome the initial resistance, the mind becomes
very bright and clear.
