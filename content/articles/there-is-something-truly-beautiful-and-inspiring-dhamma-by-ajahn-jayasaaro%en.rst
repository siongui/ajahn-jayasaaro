There is something truly beautiful and inspiring in seeing a person given to the
pursuit of essentially trivial goals such as wealth and power wake up to the
preciousness of this human birth, and take a new direction in their life. Seeing
the kindness of someone who used to be unfeeling, or the humble behaviour of
someone who used to be extremely conceited is especially moving.

People can change in the most uplifting ways. Not through an act of will or the
grace of a god, but through patient and intelligent effort. The Buddha declared
that seeing someone change in this way is as beautiful as seeing the bright full
moon emerge from behind a dark cloud.
