Shortly before he passed away, the Buddha gave his last instructions to his
disciples. He simply reminded them of the impermanent nature of all things, and
encouraged them to perfect themselves in heedfulness (Pāli: ‘appamāda’)

To be heedful means to take nothing for granted. Heedful people have no sense of
entitlement. They do not expect that things will just work out by themselves.
They do not look to comfort themselves with prayers and ceremonies. They seek to
create an inner refuge. Heedful people do not fall into the traps of pointless
worry or unrealistic hopes about the future. They put their energy into creating
a readiness to face up to whatever life brings them with calm patience, kindness
and wisdom.

My new year's blessing is then not that everything in your life goes the way you
want it to go. It won't. My heartfelt wish is that you can develop the inner
resources to deal wisely with all of your challenges and to flourish both in the
outer world of duties and responsibilities and the inner world of the mind.
