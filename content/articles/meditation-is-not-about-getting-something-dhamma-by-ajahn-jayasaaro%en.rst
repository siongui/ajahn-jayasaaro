Meditation is not about getting something. It's about learning how to face up to
the present moment in the wisest way possible way. One day you may be learning
about peaceful states of mind, and on another day you may be learning about
unpeaceful states of mind. It's certainly more enjoyable to learn about peaceful
states of mind, but not necessarily any more beneficial.
Some people say they are too agitated to meditate. That is like saying that you
are too sick to take medicine
