Over and over again in our meditation practice we return to the breath with an
unwavering determination to free the mind from all that imprisons it. We relate
to the experience of the breath with a mind that is bright, attentive and
wakeful, firm and kind. We observe the quality and intensity of our effort and
adjust it when necessary. We abandon all love for distraction.
Learning how to be with the breath, we learn how to be with all experience. As
we progress, the distinction between the mind in meditation and in daily life
begins to dissolve
