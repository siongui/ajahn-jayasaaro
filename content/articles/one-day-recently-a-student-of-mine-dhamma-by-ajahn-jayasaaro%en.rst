One day recently a student of mine was praised for being kind. As a result, he
immediately felt a warm feeling in his heart. Later, he wondered whether his
reaction was a mental defilement. He asked me “Do truly wise people feel
pleasure when they are praised?”

I replied that wise people do not see themselves as the owners of their good
qualities. They don't crave praise for their goodness or become attached to it.
But they may feel a kind of joy, just as gardeners may feel when people praise
the beauty of flowers in their garden.
