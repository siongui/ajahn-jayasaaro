Even with teachers who care for us so much and give us so many wise teachings
we find progress on the path to be slow and difficult. How much more difficult
it would be without a teacher! And how marvellous that the Buddha realised
supreme enlightenment all by himself! He completely eliminated every kind of
mental defilement, and achieved absolute perfection in virtue, wisdom and
compassion without anyone to show him the way. For this reason we bow at his
feet.
Even to successfully explain very simple matters to people we know and love can
be a real challenge. How wonderful that the Buddha was able to explain the most
profound matters with words that have touched the hearts of people all over the
world for over 2600 years! For his skill and patience in teaching the Dhamma we
bow at his feet.
Even to create a family or an organisation or an institue that can thrive and
prosper for two generations is a great achievement. The Buddha created a
monastic order that has survived over a hundred generations, and has preserved
his path to liberation and transmitted it to countless beings.
For his wisdom and kindness in ensuring the happiness of future generations, we
bow at his feet.
