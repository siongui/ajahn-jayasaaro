Today is Māgha Pūja, the first of the three annual Buddhist holidays celebrated
in Thailand. On this day we commemorate the occasion on which the Buddha
delivered the Ovāda Pātimokkha discourse to the 1,250 arahants who had converged
without prior agreement on the Bamboo Grove Monastery where he was residing.

In this discourse the Buddha lays down the basic principles of the teachings
that his enlightened disciples could memorise and use as a reference as they
wandered throughout India, spreading the Dhamma. The Buddha declares Nibbāna,
liberation from all suffering and its causes as supreme; patient endurance as
the most powerful tool for eliminating defilements. Non-harming is the defining
virtue of the monastic. One intent on the goal must be devoted to morality,
moderation, seclusion and meditation. The Buddha summarises the teachings as the
effort to abandon all that is unwholesome in the mind, to cultivate all that is
wholesome, and to purify the heart
