The ancient sages have reminded us to look at the moon, not the finger pointing
to the moon. They mean that we should not allow ourselves to become obsessed
with words and terminology, but focus on the truth that the words refer to.

And it is not only words that lead us to the Dhamma. As we learn how to let go
of seeing everything that happens in terms of ‘me’ or ‘mine’, more and more of
our daily experiences of pain and pleasure, gain and loss are revealed as being
also like fingers pointing to the moon.
