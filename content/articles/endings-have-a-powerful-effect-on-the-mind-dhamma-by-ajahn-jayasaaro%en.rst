Endings have a powerful effect on the mind. If a difficult conversation ends
well, for example, we usually recall it as basically positive. If a friendly
conversation ends badly, our abiding memory tends to be a negative one. For this
reason we should be very mindful of the quality of the endings in our life. A
good ending can salvage a difficult experience. A bad ending can spoil a good
one.

At the end of the day, before going to sleep, pay homage to the Buddha, the
Dhamma and the Sangha. Calm your mind with meditation on the breath. Recall the
things and people that you feel grateful for. Spread thoughts of loving kindness
to all beings, and dedicate the fruits of your good actions to them. End this
day well, and tomorrow will begin well.
