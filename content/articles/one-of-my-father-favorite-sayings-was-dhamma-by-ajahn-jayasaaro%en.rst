One of my father's favorite sayings was, ‘If a job is worth doing, it is worth
doing well.’ In other words, once you have made a commitment, you should apply
yourself to it to the best of your ability, not in a shoddy, half-hearted
manner.

In my own life, I have discovered another truth: ‘If a job is worth doing, it is
worth doing badly.’ In other words, don't avoid doing things worth doing simply
because you won't be able to do them very well at first. Be willing and humble
enough to start doing something badly and learn from your mistakes. Don't worry
about making a fool of yourself. One of the reasons I learnt the Thai language
so quickly was that I didn't mind when people laughed at my mistakes.
