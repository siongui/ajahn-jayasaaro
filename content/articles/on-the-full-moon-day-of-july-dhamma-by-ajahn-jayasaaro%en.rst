On the full moon day of July well over 2500 years ago the Buddha walked into the
Deer Park in Sarnath in north-eastern India. His intention was to ‘set in motion
the wheel of Dhamma’ by giving his first ever teaching. His proposed audience
consisted of five former followers. These five men had abandoned him after he
renounced the practice of severe asceticism. They believed that by giving up
asceticism he had given up the path to enlightenment, and would soon return to a
life of luxury in his father's palace.

The Buddha immediately put their minds to rest by telling them that a life of
sensual indulgence was ignoble and meaningless. But their relief turned to
surprise when he continued to say that a life of severe ascetism was also
ignoble and meaningless. The the Buddha taught a middle way between these two
extremes. It involved a comprehensive education of action, speech and mind that
led to true freedom by eliminating the ignorance and craving that is the cause
of human suffering. At the end of the talk, Kondañña, the leader of the group of
five, realised ‘Stream Entry’ the first level of enlightenment.

Today, throughout the Buddhist world we commemorate this special day.
