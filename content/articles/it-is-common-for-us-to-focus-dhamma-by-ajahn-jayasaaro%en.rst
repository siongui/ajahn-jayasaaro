It is common for us to focus too much on what makes us different from each
other. This over-emphasis leads to arrogance and insecurity, prejudice and fear.

As Buddhists we seek to prevent this imbalance by constantly returning to an
awareness of those things that unite us all. We reflect on the simple
indisputable truth that everyone of us are companions in birth, old age,
sickness and death. Everybody wants to be happy. Nobody wants to suffer.

We don't deny difference or ignore them. But we recognise them within the
context of our shared nature as sentient beings in a challenging and fragile
world.
