Going into nature means entering a world that has its own rules, rules that make
no compromises with your desires. You cannot bargain with nature. You cannot
bully it. Nature is unmoved by your tears. If you are to survive in nature you
must respect it. You must learn its ways and adapt to it.

When you are respectful and humble, patient, alert and intelligent then nature
will bless you with joy and understanding. This is true of both the world around
us, and the world that we discover when we close our eyes in meditation.
