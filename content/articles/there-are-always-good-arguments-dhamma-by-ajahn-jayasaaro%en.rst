There are always good arguments for not meditating. Apart from the favorite,
‘I'm too busy’, there are many others: ‘it's too early, it's too late, I'm too
hungry, I'm too full, I'm too tired, I'm too restless’. We always seem to be
‘too’ something or other to meditate.

Please don't make meditation into a burden. Try seeing it as spending quality
time with your mind. Don't fight with yourself. Be reasonable, gentle and firm.
Agree that yes, I am busy; yes, I am tired, and so on. But rather than deciding
that given these factors you won't meditate at all, choose to meditate just a
little bit, just for a short while, just for a few minutes. Decide, ‘I will do
it, without expectations, as an offering to the Buddha, as an offering to my
teachers.’

You may find that you meditate longer than you intended.
