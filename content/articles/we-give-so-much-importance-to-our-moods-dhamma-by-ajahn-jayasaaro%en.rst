We give so much importance to our moods. We feel stupid and we conclude that we
are stupid. We feel good and we conclude that everything is good. We feel bored
and we conclude that our situation is boring. We feel depressed and conclude
that our life is depressing.

Don't hold on to ideas about how you should or should not feel. Simply look at
how you are feeling right now and see that as a feeling. No more and no less. A
feeling is not who you are. A feeling is not necessarily a reflection of how
your life is.
