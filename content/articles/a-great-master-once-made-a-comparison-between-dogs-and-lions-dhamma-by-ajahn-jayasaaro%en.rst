A great master once made a comparison between dogs and lions. He said that if
someone were to throw a rock at a dog, the dog would immediately attack the
rock. However, if they were foolish enough to throw a rock at a lion, the lion
would ignore the rock and attack the thrower.
When encountering an upsetting situation most people minds react like the dog:
they immediately become obsessed by whatever arises in their mind at that moment
- be it fear, anger or confusion. Meditators, however, are like lions. They are
able to see beyond the immediate impact and understand the context and the
causes and conditions of the problem; then they are able to deal with it wisely.
