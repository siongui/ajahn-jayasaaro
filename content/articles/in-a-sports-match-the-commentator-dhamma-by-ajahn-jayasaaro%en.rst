In a sports match the commentator informs his audience about everything that is
happening on the pitch. He expresses excitement and admiration, criticism and
expectation. The commentator's words have nothing to do with the game itself.
Without the commentator the game would carry on in exactly the same way.

In our meditation practice we have so many voices inside us commentating on our
performance: voices expressing appreciation and criticism, judgement and
anticipation. We assume that these are the voices of objective commentators like
the ones who watch sports matches. In fact all of the voices are part of the
practice, not observers of it. Meditators must be mindful and alert to all of
the voices. If we take them seriously they can become considerable hindrances on
the path to liberation. If we simply recognize them for what they are --
'There's the judge', 'That's anxiety come to visit again' -- they soon leave of
their own accord
