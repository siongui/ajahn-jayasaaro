Just as a dew drop on the tip of a blade of grass will quickly vanish when the
sun rises, even so is human life like a dew drop.

Just as a line drawn on water will quickly disappear, even so is human life like
a line drawn on water.

Just as a mountain stream flowing swiftly will not stand still even for a single
instant of time, even so is human life like a mountain stream.

Reflecting on the truth of impermanence in this way inspires within us a sense
of urgency. It is only through practising the Dhamma that we can give our life
genuine meaning and purpose.
