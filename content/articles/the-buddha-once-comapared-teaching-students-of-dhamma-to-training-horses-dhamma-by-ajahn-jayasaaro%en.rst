The Buddha once compared teaching students of Dhamma to training horses. He said
that some horses run at the mere shadow of the whip, and some when they feel the
whip touch their skin. Some horses only run when they feel the whip bite into
their skin, and the worst ones, only when the whip cuts to the bone.
If we are mindful and awake to all that the world is teaching us, we can be like
the best horse, or at least, the second. What we should avoid is being the worst
kind of horse: only turning to Dhamma with any sincerity when we experience some
deep pain in our lives.
