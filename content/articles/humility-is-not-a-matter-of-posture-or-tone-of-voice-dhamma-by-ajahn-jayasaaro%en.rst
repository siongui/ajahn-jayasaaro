Humility is not a matter of posture or tone of voice. If people bow their heads
and speak with great deference, or speak critically of themselves, it does not
mean that they are being humble. The outer forms of humility can be faked and
self-disparagement is often a form of conceit.
Genuine humility grows through the lessening of attachment to views and
opinions. Humility flourishes when we are not so concerned with appearing in a
certain way to those around us, and when we don't consider that making mistakes
is a cause for humiliation. Humility arises when the love of truth stronger than
the love of self.
