Today is Visakha Puja. It is the day that we commemorate the birth,
enlightenment and passing away of the Buddha. Although these three events took
place a long time ago it is now as important as ever to recognise their
significance . The appearance of a Buddha in the world is a proof and an
affirmation of the potential of human beings to realise the highest spiritual
goal through their own efforts, without the need for support or guidance from
any unseen beings. As Buddhists we believe that anyone, man or woman, who
follows in the footsteps of the Buddha, can eliminate all defilements and the
suffering which they cause.

We pay true homage to the Buddha by putting forth sincere effort to cultivate
our actions, speech and mind so as to realise the true nature of things, for the
long-lasting welfare and happiness of ourself and all fellow beings.
