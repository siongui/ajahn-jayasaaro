We create a false sense of self moment by moment by the way we relate to our
body, feelings, memories, perceptions, thoughts, emotions and sense
consciousness.

1. We may assume those phenomena to be one and the same thing as self, just as
   we consider there to be no separation between the colour of a flame and the
   flame itself

2. We may consider those phenomena as belonging to self in the way that a tree's
   shadow belongs to the tree.

3. We may consider those phenomena as being in self, as the scent is in the
   flower.

4. We may consider those phenomena as containing the self as a casket contains a
   jewel.

We don't have to abandon the self, there is nothing to abandon. We abandon the
craving and attachment that are the conditions for the illusion of self.
