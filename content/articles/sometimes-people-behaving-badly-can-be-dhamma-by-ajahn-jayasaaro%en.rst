Sometimes people behaving badly can be of as much benefit to us as those who
behave well and are our role models. At least this is true when we can put down
any personal feelings of aversion towards them. Looking wisely at a very selfish
person, for example, practitioners ask themselves with sincerity ‘Selfishness is
such an ugly destructive thing. Am I also selfish like this? How can I free
myself from it.’ They make a determination: ‘Although I can do little to get
other people to let go of their selfishness, at least I will let go of the
selfishness in my own mind, and be a good example to others.’

Looking at the world around us in this way, we do not become depressed. We see
all the people acting in foolish and harmful ways as reminding us how not to
lead our lives; we feel strengthened in our resolve to follow the path of
Buddha. These people are also our teachers.
