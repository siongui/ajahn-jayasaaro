The eight worldly conditions are gain and loss, status and obscurity, praise and
criticism, pleasure and pain. Wherever we go, there is no escape from these
things. They are always present, whether we are in a busy city or a secluded
monastery. Even fully enlightened beings experience them.
The mental suffering lies not in the conditions themselves, but in our attitude
towards them. Unwise people take the eight worldly conditions very seriously,
because they do not see how temporary, unreliable, and unable to provide true
happiness they all are. People become attached to gain, status, praise and
pleasure. They fear separation from them and when they experience their
opposites: loss, a decline in status, criticism, and pain, they feel grief and
depression. The wise know these eight conditions for what they are: unavoidable
aspects of the human realm. They look after their minds, not allowing them to
become obsessed by mere worldly conditions
