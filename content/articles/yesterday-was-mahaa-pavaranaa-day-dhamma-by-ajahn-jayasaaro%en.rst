Yesterday was Mahā Pavaranā Day, the last day of the Sangha's annual three-month
Rains Retreat. On this day monastic communities come together to perform a
ceremony in which every monk makes himself open to admonition from every other
monk for any inappropriate behaviour he may have committed during the retreat.

The willingness to sincerely open ourselves to admonition from all those around
us, irrespective of seniority, is one of the surest ways to get to know our
blind spots and deal with them. The willingness to offer admonition at the right
time and place, with kindness and well-chosen words, is one of the signs of a
true friend
