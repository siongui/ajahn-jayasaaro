On one occasion a brahmin went to see the Buddha and abused him with rude, harsh
words. When he had finished speaking, the Buddha asked the brahmin whether
friends and relatives ever come to visit him at his house. He replied that they
did. The Buddha then asked if he had food prepared for his guests and the
brahmin replied that he did. And then the Buddha asked:

“If they don't accept the food from you, then to whom does it belong?”

“Then it still belongs to me”

“So too, brahmin, I do not abuse anybody, do not scold anyone, do not condemn
anyone. I refuse to accept from you the abuse and the scolding and the
condemnation you have given me today. It still belongs to you, brahmin.”

We cannot prevent people offering us abuse. But we can refuse to accept it by
remaining calm and not getting drawn into their anger, or returning their abuse
