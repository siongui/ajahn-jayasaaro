When sitting and walking meditation are practised alternately, meditators are
able to greatly extend the length of time they can meditate. Alternating the two
kinds of meditation allows meditators to develop awareness both in stillness and
movement, thus independent of posture. If either sitting or walking is
preferred, then the preferred option can be longer, but the other option should
not be abandoned altogether. The particular value of walking meditation is that
it produces an awareness more easily integrated into daily life than that which
is cultivated in the sitting meditation. Walking mindfully in nature, up and
down on a path some twenty to thirty paces long, in the shade of tall trees, is
a wonderful practice! Walking meditation is especially valuable for those
discouraged by painful feelings during sitting meditation.
