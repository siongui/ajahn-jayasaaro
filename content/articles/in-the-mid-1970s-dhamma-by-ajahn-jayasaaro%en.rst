In the mid-1970s, before I became a monk, I spent a year in India. Many of
Westerners I met there were interested in hallucinogenic drugs as a means to
realize higher states of consciousness.
For many years, a German Buddhist teacher, Lama Govinda, lived in the Himalayas,
near Almora. One day, a Western traveller asked him:
“What do you think about mind-expanding drugs?”
Lama Govinda gave a brilliant reply
“If your mind is ignorant, the only result will be expanded ignorance”

Buddhism is not about gaining special state of mind. It is about finding freedom
from ignorance
