One common tendency of the mind is to overly complicate simple matters. As a
result we get bogged down in details and make little progress.

Another tendency is to overly simplify complex matters. As a result we make fast
progress for a while but then have to correct for distortions and omissions of
key information. Ultimately, little progress is made.

The middle way becomes clear through recognising our attitude to simplicity and
complexity.

If we find ourselves feeling threatened by simplicity we must be patient with
that feeling, and refrain from using thought as a means of procrastination.

If we find ourselves impatient with complexity we must be patient with that
feeling and refrain from taking action as a means to avoid the need to think
something through
