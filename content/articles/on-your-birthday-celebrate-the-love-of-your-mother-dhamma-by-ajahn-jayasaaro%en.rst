On your birthday celebrate the love of your mother. Remember that you have
gained this precious human birth because of the love and sacrifices of your
mother. How much discomfort your mother willingly experienced for nine whole
months so that you could be born! If she gave birth naturally, your mother
endured the most painful experience that a human being can know so that you
could gain this precious human birth. She did this gladly. When she saw you for
the first time she cried for joy. It is this human birth, this human body and
mind that gives you the opportunity to realise peace, wisdom and compassion. On
your birthday remember your mother who made this life possible. On my 58th
birthday, I offer this reflection and my blessings to you all.

Phra Ajahn Jayasaro
