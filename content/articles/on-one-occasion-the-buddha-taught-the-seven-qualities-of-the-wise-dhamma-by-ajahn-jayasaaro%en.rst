On one occasion the Buddha taught the seven qualities of the wise:

1. They know the principles, actions, causes and conditions leading to
   fulfilment of their goals.
2. They know the meaning, the purpose, the goal, the outcome of their actions
   and of prevailing conditions.
3. They know themselves, their roles and responsibilities, the present extent of
   their knowledge and abilities, their strengths and weaknesses.
4. They know the right or optimum amount - not too much or too little - in
   actions of body and speech, in consumption and expenditure.
5. They know the right time and place to speak and act. They act and speak in a
   way appropriate to time and place. They are on time for appointments and the
   completion of tasks.
6. They know groups of people: in a given group or meeting or community they
   know the most appropriate way to conduct themselves.
7. They know people: they can recognize an individual's temperament, abilities,
   virtues and vices. They know who to associate with and the best way to
   associate with others.
