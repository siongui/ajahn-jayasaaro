It is not just a matter of knowing the theory, knowing the method, that is
important. Of course, knowing the exact means by which we can let go the
defilements that are fuelling our suffering is essential. But it is equally
important to maintain the will to apply that knowledge.

Sometimes, we can be blind to the truth that one part of us does not want to be
free. Maybe we believe that we deserve the suffering, or want to punish ourself
for past misdeeds, or fear that letting go of the suffering would lead to even
greater pain. As a result, something inside us holds onto our suffering as if it
was a precious thing.

We all have the capacity to abandon the causes of suffering. But we must be
utterly sincere. We have to recognize that there is nothing whatsoever noble,
intelligent or appropriate about mental pain. It is completely worthless. Let it
go.
