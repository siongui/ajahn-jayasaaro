The optimist says the glass is half-full. The pessimist says the glass is
half-empty. The Buddhist says that the glass is already broken.

When we reflect on the glass as being already broken, we can use it without
attachment. We make the most intelligent use of the glass while never forgetting
its temporary nature. When it does eventually break, we are not surprised and we
don't suffer.
