Change we cannot control is frightening. The usual reaction to it is to search
for something that does not change. Dogmas recorded in holy books seem to
provide that. In times of rapid and bewildering changes fundamentalist religion
flourishes. Superstition and prejudice infect people like a virus.
In Buddhism we look at the sense of insecurity without trying to suppress it
with beliefs. When we investigate our life with a mind calmed by meditation we
can see that there is no solid ‘me’ facing a threatening unstable world. Our
body and mind is changing moment by moment due to causes and conditions, some of
which we may influence, some we may not. The more we understand inner and outer
change, the more our anxiety dissolves. We find our refuge not in beliefs, but
in observation of the way things are
