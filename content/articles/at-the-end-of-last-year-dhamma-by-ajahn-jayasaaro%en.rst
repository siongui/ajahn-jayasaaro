At the end of last year, as I wandered through some of the most remote villages
in Bihar State in northeast India I was surprised by the dogs. Usually, village
dogs are taught to be suspicious of strangers and to bark loudly if an
unfamiliar figure approaches their master's house. These dogs simply looked at
me for a moment with lazy eyes, and then returned to what they were doing, or
went back to sleep.

It soon became clear to me that these animals had not been trained as guard dogs
because the houses contained nothing to be stolen. These people were so poor
that they had no need to be afraid of thieves.

As I walked on I reflected how much people's fear and aggression is due to their
need to protect an image of themselves. When we feel no need to hide or protect
anything about ourselves, we feel as free and relaxed as a sleepy dog in front
of an empty house.
