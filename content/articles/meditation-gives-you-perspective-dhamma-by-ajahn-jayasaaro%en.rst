Meditation gives you perspective.

Sometimes as your mind becomes calm, you suddenly realise that a problem you
have been worrying about so much is just a very small thing. Other times you
realise that a small problem you have been ignoring for some time is,
potentially, very serious, and needs seeing to straight away.

Meditation helps you to let go of things that you need to let go. It helps you
deal with the things that you need to deal with.
