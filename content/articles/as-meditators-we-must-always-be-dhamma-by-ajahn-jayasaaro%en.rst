As meditators we must always be on our guard against pride. But sometimes we go
too far. We come to believe that by downplaying the goodness within us we are
practising humility. The Buddha did not teach that kind of humility. He taught
us to observe and find joy in our good intentions and good actions. Learning how
to appreciate the goodness arising in our mind is like sprinkling it with water;
it grows and grows. Humility lies in remembering the debt of gratitude that we
owe to the Buddha and his disciples. Without the example and instructions of our
teachers these beautiful mental states would never have found a home in our
hearts. We also should remind ourselves that this goodness doesn't belong to us.
It is the result of cultivation. It will only continue to flourish if we look
after it wisely.
