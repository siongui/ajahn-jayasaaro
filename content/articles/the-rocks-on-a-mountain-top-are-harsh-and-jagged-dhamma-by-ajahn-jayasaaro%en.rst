The rocks on a mountain top are harsh and jagged because nobody disturbs them.

The rocks on a river bed are smooth and beautiful, because the water makes them
rub against each other again and again.

Living with others may not be so peaceful as living alone, but it rubs away our
jagged edges.

Do not resent the uncomfortable feelings that arise in the presence of others.
If we are wise, we can allow this friction to wear away our love of self, and
make us as smooth and beautiful as river stones.
