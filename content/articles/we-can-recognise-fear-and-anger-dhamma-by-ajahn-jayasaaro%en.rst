We can recognise fear and anger as normal reactions to aggression, without
lashing out wildly in order to make those feelings go away. We cannot expect too
much from this world. As long as foolish immature people can find justification
for their actions in philosophies and religious texts, there will never be true
peace.

What we can do is to cultivate a boundless compassion accompanied by a wisdom
that is calm, cool and alert. The wisdom we need to deal with complex problems
comes from clarity of mind, not outraged emotion.

The Buddha taught us that hatred is never overcome by hatred. If we hate those
that hate us then we too become haters, no better than them. All that results is
that the total amount of hatred in the world increases.
