It is fortunate to be able to make a living in a job that is of true benefit to
others. One such job is that of the school teacher. Transmitting knowledge is a
wonderful thing to do, but even more wonderful is transmitting a love of
learning and a love of truth. Knowledge that is learnt at school may one day
become obsolete. But a child who has been equipped with both a joy in learning
and the skills to learn, will always be ready to thrive, no matter in what
environment they find themselves, and no matter how the world changes. School
teachers who help to inspire these qualities in their students make great merit.
