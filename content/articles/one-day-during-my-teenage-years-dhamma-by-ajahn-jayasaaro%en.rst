One day during my teenage years, I remember entering a huge library and feeling
deeply discouraged. In those days I was thirsty for knowledge, I wanted to know
:underline:`everything`, and yet at that moment I became aware that even if I
was to spend my whole life in that library and do nothing but study, I would
only ever be able to read a small portion of the books gathered in it. Then as I
stood there overwhelmed, I remembered a question posed by a great Indian sage,
'What is the one thing, knowing which, you will know all things?' I realised
that it was all very simple. I didn't need to read all the books in the world. I
needed to study and understand my own mind.
There is so much we need to learn to survive in this world and prosper. But the
most important thing of all is to know the one who knows.
