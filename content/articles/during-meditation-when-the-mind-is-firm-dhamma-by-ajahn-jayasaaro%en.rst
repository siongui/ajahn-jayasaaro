During meditation, when the mind is firm, clear and alert in the present moment,
it as if the world and the person we believe ourself to be, disappears for a
while. At that time we have no sense of name, gender or status. We do not
experience ourself as a son or daughter, as a sibling, a spouse or a parent. We
don't look on ourself as good or bad, intelligent or stupid. We have entered
another dimension of life, one characterised by a feeling of well-being that
seems completely normal and natural. It is as if we have come home.

Opening our eyes and returning to the world of relationships and
responsibilities, the memory of that other more profound dimension of life gives
us a new perspective. We are conscious of a realm of peace within us, untouched
by all the ups and downs of daily life. We fully participate in our world but
don't take it quite so seriously as before.
