In the Samyutta Nikāya the Buddha says:

“Unimaginable, bhikkhus, is a beginning to the round of rebirths. For beings
obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving, migrating and going the round
of rebirths, a starting point is not to be found. It is not easy, bhikkhus, to
find a being who has not formerly been one's mother ... been one's father ...
one's brother ... sister ... son ... daughter during this long long time.”

- S.N. 15. 14-19

And if this is true, how can we not forgive those that hurt us?
