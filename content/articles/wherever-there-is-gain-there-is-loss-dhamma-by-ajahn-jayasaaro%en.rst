| Wherever there is gain there is loss.
| Wherever there is status there is loss of status.
| Wherever there is pleasure there is pain.
| Wherever there is praise there is blame.

We desire gain, status, pleasure and praise. We fear and dislike their
opposites. But these things are inseparable. The more we attach to the
impermanent states that we like, the more we suffer when they disappear.

Gains and losses ebb and flow. There is no stability. The wise person takes
nothing for granted and so at a time of gain is not intoxicated and at a time of
loss is not brought to despair
