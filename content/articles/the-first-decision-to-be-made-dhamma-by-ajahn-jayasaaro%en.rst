The first decision to be made regarding a particular pleasure is whether or not
to experience it at all. The criterion here is whether or not doing so will lead
to harm to oneself or others, in the short or long-term. We may examine this
question, for example, in terms of physical harm, mental harm, harm to
relationships, harm to wealth and harm to reputation. Our bottom line as
Buddhists is that we renounce any pleasure that would involve breaking our
precepts. The second decision concerns to what extent a pleasure that passes the
non-harm test may or should be pursued by one who is devoted to the Buddha's
path of awakening. Some pleasurable experiences are more uplifting than others.
As our time is short and unpredictable, it makes sense to give most importance
to those pleasurable experiences that directly contribute to the basic sense of
well-being that provides the foundation for effective Dhamma practice. These
are, in short, to be found in the feelings of pleasure experienced through acts
of generosity, feelings of pleasure accompanying the freedom from remorse, and
sense of self-respect that arise from keeping precepts, and the joy and bliss
arising through meditation.
