In a group of a hundred people, silence can only occur when all hundred people
co-operate - not an easy thing at all. In a group of a hundred people, however,
noise and disturbance may be caused by a single person.

A forest that has stood for a thousand years may be destroyed by a single fire.
A building that took hundreds of years to complete may be destroyed in a single
bomb blast. Good kamma accumulated over many lifetimes may be destroyed by a
single moment of anger.

Care for the good. Learn how to protect it. Never take it for granted. Goodness
is a beautiful and fragile flower.
