It is not enough to make sure that our views and opinions are reasonable and
well-founded. We must also learn how to hold them well. If we grasp onto our
views too tightly it feels as if they become a part of us. Then, if anyone
criticizes our view it seems like a personal attack, and that is painful. So,
with mindfulness, try to see a view as a view, an opinion as an opinion. No
more, no less.
