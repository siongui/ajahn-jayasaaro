Today is the 24th anniversary of the death of Ajahn Cha. His disciples have
gathered together in his monastery for three days of Dhamma practice in his
honour. This afternoon thousands of people will circumnambulate the stupa in
which his relics are enshrined in a beautiful ceremony of remembrance.

All the qualities of the Kalyānamitta, the True Good Friend, were possessed by
Ajahn Cha. He inspired his disciples with love and affection, with respect and
with the determination to practice his teachings and follow in his footsteps. He
was patient with the defilements of his disciples. He never became discouraged
in teaching them. He willingly endured much pain and suffering in order to teach
the Dhamma. He was a master of effective communication, adapting his words and
manner to the needs of his audience. He was able to reveal the Dhamma in a
clear, direct way that made even the most profound subject understandable. He
never misled any of his disciples. He never abused his authority or trust in
him.

His life was the most wonderful gift to the world. At his feet, I bow my head.
