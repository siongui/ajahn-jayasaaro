As a schoolboy I was quite curious. I liked asking questions and looking at
things from unusual angles. One day I received an essay I'd written back from my
English teacher. Commenting on the ideas in my essay, he'd written in the margin
'Not all questions that can be asked need to be answered.' More than forty years
later I still feel grateful to my teacher for this comment.
We can waste so much time asking questions that don't need to be answered. In
doing so we neglect asking questions that should be asked. Calming the mind and
choosing the best questions to ask in any difficult situation is an important
life skill to develop.
Here is an example of a question that should be avoided. When a problem arises,
or a mistake is made, the common tendency is to ask, 'Who is to blame?' This
question over-simplifies issues and sets people against each other. A better
question to ask is 'what did each person or each party involved contribute to
this problem or mistake. Looking at contributions rather than deciding who is to
blame leads to clarity and intelligent solutions
