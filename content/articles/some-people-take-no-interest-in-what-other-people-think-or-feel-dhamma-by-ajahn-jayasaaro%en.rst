Some people take no interest in what other people think or feel. They are very
confident. They think they are smart. They do what they want to do and refuse to
take any responsibility for the suffering they cause other people. They think
they are winners and everyone else are losers.
Other people care too much about what other people think or feel. They worry all
the time about how they are being judged for their actions. They want everyone
to like them. Sometimes they do things they know are wrong because they crave
the praise of others and fear criticism.
The first group of people take themselves as refuge. The second group take other
people as refuge. These refuges are narrow, foolish and unsafe. The Buddha
taught us to take the Dhamma as our refuge. This means basing our life on
generosity, precepts and inner cultivation.
