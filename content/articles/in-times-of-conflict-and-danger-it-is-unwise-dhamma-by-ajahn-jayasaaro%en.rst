In times of conflict and danger it is unwise to place too much trust in a
fearless person. Those without fear are usually reckless and endanger all those
around them. Their fearlessness tends to come from a moral deficiency rather
than a nobility of mind. True heroes are not those who feel no fear, but those
who do not allow their actions to be determined by the fears that arise and pass
away in their hearts. They constantly seek the right thing to do, or at least
the most right, and to take that as their guide. They are firm and resolute but
not inflexible.
