Perhaps you have started climbing a mountain from a valley which contains a
swiftly flowing river. You will have noticed that when you look down from a spot
high upon the mountain, the river now seems to be flowing much more slowly. You
are reminded how your perception of movement is conditioned by distance.

Practising mindfulness is like climbing the mountain. The more you do it, the
more you feel aware of, but above, the swiftly moving events of life. Everything
seems to be moving much more slowly. You have more time to act wisely.
