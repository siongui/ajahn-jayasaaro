Dwelling in the present moment, in the Buddhist sense, does not mean that there
must be no thoughts of the past and future in the mind at all. It means that
there is no entanglement with those thoughts. It means that we learn how to
relinquish our habit of escaping into memory and fantasy as a means of avoiding
present discomfort.

The Buddha himself spoke of the past and future when there was a good reason to
do so. He related stories from his past lives to edify the monks, and spoke on
many occasions of the causes and conditions that would lead to future
flourishing or decline. On appropriate occasions he drew upon memory and
projected causal relationships into the future. But while he was doing this, he
never slipped from the present moment.
