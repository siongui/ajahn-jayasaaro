One of the most powerful superstitions in the human mind is the belief that as
long as there is growth, increase, gain in our life, we are safe. In other
words, as long as we are accumulating wealth, status, experiences we will not
die. It is not just greed that drives people to compulsively add to what they
have already. It is the fear of death. The Buddha taught us to understand gain
and loss, to understand their relationship, to see gain as simply gain and loss
as simply loss. Most importantly, he taught us to look within at the very root
of our fear of death
