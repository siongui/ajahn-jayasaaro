Lūang Phau Līam, Lūang Phau Chā's successor as abbot of Wat Pā Phong only went
to school for a few years. Nevertheless, without academic training he has
designed and overseen the construction of many monastic buildings, including the
large Dhamma Hall in his own monastery. He has also worked as a craftsman and a
labourer on these projects. He does everything in a calm, unruffled way. He is a
great teacher of mindfulness in action.

One evening after a long hot day on a major construction project some lay guests
visited him. They asked when the work would be finished. Lūang Phau Līam
replied, ‘I finish every day.’

Lūang Phau meant by this that whenever his body left the work site his mind left
too. He didn't carry worries and unresolved issues with him. This is the value
of a well-trained mind. When it needs to think and plan and solve problems, it
does so; when there is no need to think it can put down the thinking until it's
time to work once more. This may sound impossible but monks like Lūang Phau Līam
prove that through practice of the Buddhs's teachings it can be done.
