A Nobel Truth is one that ennobles the person who truly understands it. 'There
is suffering' is a Nobel Truth. 'I am suffering' is not. Enlightenment occurs
only after we have seen suffering as a conditioned phenomena. Only depression,
self-aversion and self-pity result from taking it personally.
The understanding that 'there is suffering' arises from observation of
experience.
Whenever we don't pay attention to the reality of our body and mind, we create
the sense of 'I'. In Dhamma practice we learn how to stop taking this 'I' so
seriously, and ultimately how to let it go.
