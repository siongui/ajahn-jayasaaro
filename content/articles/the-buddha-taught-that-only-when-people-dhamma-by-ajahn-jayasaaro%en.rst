The Buddha taught that only when people are free of worries concerning the
essential needs for clothing, food, shelter and medical care, can they progress
spiritually. Rather than overlooking the importance of material development the
Buddha recognised that it forms the necessary foundation for the fulfilment of
the deeper spiritual needs. Problems arise when material development becomes the
sole focus of life. The results of such an approach range from stress and
depression to drug abuse and suicide. A balanced life is one in which we take
care of both inner and outer needs. But as inner needs are not so obvious and
outer needs are much more pressing, time for inner cultivation does not often
present itself. We must make time for it.
