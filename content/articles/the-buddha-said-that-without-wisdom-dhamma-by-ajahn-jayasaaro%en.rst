The Buddha said that without wisdom being close to the teacher or the teachings
we are like a spoon that gains no knowledge of the taste of the food. With
wisdom, we are like the tongue that knows every taste of the food. Proximity to
great masters is not enough in itself. One long-time disciple of Ajahn Cha never
overcame his bad temper. Finally, one day, he killed someone in a fit of rage.
Not long after he died in prison, not of a physical illness, but from his
feelings of shame.

So where does this wisdom come from? We can't just decide to be wise. What we
can do is to be sincere in letting go of all those habits and attachments that
impede the flow of wisdom. We approach the Dhamma with a mind which is open and
attentive, humble, alert and calm.
