‘Kamma’ refers to intention expressed through body, speech or mind. Moment by
moment, our lives are shaped and sustained by kamma. Every intentional action
affects the quality of our life, both in the present and the future. Meditation
practices are so important because they allow us to systematically train
intention. In our efforts to keep the mind on the meditation object, we learn
how to strengthen wholesome intentions. In our efforts to let go of the
hindrances to meditation we learn how to weaken and abandon unwholesome
intentions. Meditation skills become life skills.
