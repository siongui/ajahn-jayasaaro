We tend to assume that when we find an idea difficult to understand, it must be
profound. But in fact, arguments expressed in unnecessarily long words and
jargon are often quite shallow. Language is being used in them to disguise the
idea rather than reveal it, and to intimidate the student.

The most profound matters are not so difficult to understand intellectually.
What could be simpler to explain than impermanence? The challenge is to train
the mind to the level that the intellectual understanding may act as a
springboard to a direct life-changing insight, beyond the reach of words.
