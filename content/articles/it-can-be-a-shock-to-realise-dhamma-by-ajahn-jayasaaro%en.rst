It can be a shock to realise how difficult it is to define common words that we
have been using since we were children. For example, what exactly does the word
‘good’ mean?
The word ‘good’ can only be understood when we have a clear idea of ‘best’. The
good is what takes us closer to the best. Given that every philosophy and
religion has a different idea of ‘best’ it follows that although they all use
the word ‘good’ they do not necessarily refer to the same thing.
In Buddhism, the best manifests as the perfection of wisdom, compassion, and
purity of heart. Acting to promote wisdom, compassion, and purity of heart in
ourselves and in others is our understanding of goodness.
