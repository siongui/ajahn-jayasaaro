Theravādan Buddhists believe that the Buddha was born, realized enlightenment
and passed away on the full moon of May. This day is known as Visākha Pūjā (or
Vesak) and is commemorated around the world. In Thailand, after the moon has
risen, lay Buddhists join monks and nuns in candle-lit circumambulations around
stūpas or Buddha statues in monasteries.

The Buddha grew up in luxurious surroundings. He left all comfort behind him in
order to search for the truth. He spent years practising the most severe
austerities before realizing that asceticism could not burn away the deepest
defilements in the human heart.

On the night of the full moon of May, as he meditated under a bodhi tree, the
Buddha discovered the Middle Way between indulgence of the senses and blind
asceticism. He proved through his own efforts that human beings have within them
the potential to transcend all suffering. He spent the rest of his life teaching
the path to liberation with wisdom and compassion.
