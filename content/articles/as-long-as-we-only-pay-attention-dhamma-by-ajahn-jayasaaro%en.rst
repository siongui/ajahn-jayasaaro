| As long as we only pay attention to beginnings,
| greed will always be our master.
| And so in order to master greed,
| the wise turn their minds towards endings.
| They fully experience the feeling
| between the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.
|
| Every single experience we have ever had
| or ever will have
| has come to an end
| or will do so.
| Nothing lasts.
| How simple a truth!
| How profound an insight!
|
| There is no need to fight with greed;
| simply open the mind to impermanence
| Greed feeds on narrow and distorted perceptions.
| Looking more closely at the body and mind,
| greed begins to fade.
