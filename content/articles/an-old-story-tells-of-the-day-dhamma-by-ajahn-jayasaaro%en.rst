An old story tells of the day on which Jīvaka, the Buddha's physician, graduated
from his medical studies at Taxila University. On that morning Jīvaka's teacher
gave him the task of walking out in the countryside surrounding the university
for the whole day and of bringing him back specimens of every kind of plant with
no medicinal properties whatsoever. Jīvaka returned in the evening, head
downcast. He had been unable to find a single plant with no medicinal properties
at all, and he was sure that he had failed his exam. But his teacher smiled and
said ‘Now that you have realised that every single plant has a medicinal
property of one kind or another, you are ready to leave the university, go out
into the world, and begin healing.

All unenlightened beings suffer. With Right View, every single experience,
welcome or unwelcome, pleasant or painful, may be used by students of Buddhism
to cure the ignorance and craving that causes that suffering. Our love of
learning and capacity for learning enables us to go beyond a life in which we
are endlessly struggling to escape the unpleasant and hold tightly to the
pleasant.
