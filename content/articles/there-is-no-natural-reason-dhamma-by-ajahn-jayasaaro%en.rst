There is no natural reason why red should mean stop and green mean go. And yet,
when we reach a traffic light we all stop at the red and go at the green. We do
so because we have all agreed on the meanings of red and green in this context.
There are so many things in our daily life that depend upon a shared agreement.
Money is another obvious example. There is no natural reason why we should be
able to exchange a bank note for goods or services. We are able to do so because
we have all agreed that it is possible to do so. A thing that exists because of
a shared agreement is called a convention. In the ability to create conventions
we see the genius of human intelligence

The difficulty with conventions is that we tend to confuse them with natural
truths. We give them too much importance, get attached to them, and so we
suffer. The most fundamental of our conventions, and the one we attach to the
most, is the idea of self. In Buddhism we do not reject conventions. We simply
learn to see conventions as conventions, without taking them to be ultimately
real. By doing so, we are able to use conventions wisely, we live in a world of
conventions without being deluded by them
