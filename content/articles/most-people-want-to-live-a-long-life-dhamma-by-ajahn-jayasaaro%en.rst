Most people want to live a long life. But, in fact, when you consider it, that
implies wanting to be old for a long time. I'm not sure that's always such a
desirable thing.

There is a better way of extending our life span. When we look at our mind, we
can observe how much time every day we get lost in memory and desire and mental
chatter. Ajahn Chah used to say that at such mindless moments it is as if we are
dead, and that we are only truly alive when we are fully awake. If we can accept
the truth of his words then we will see that the best way of living a long happy
life is to extend the time every day when we are awake and aware.
