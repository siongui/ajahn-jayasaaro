Late last year as I walked along a minor road in northeast India, a young man
approached me. He said that I should cross over and walk on the other side of
the road. I thanked him for his concern but told him that I liked to walk on the
right side, facing oncoming traffic. He became quite upset and insisted, “No,
you do not understand. In my India we are walking on the left side of the road.
Please you cross over!” Seeing the young man's growing anger, I crossed the
road.

It was the words ‘My India’ that warned me that this was not a simple
disagreement about the best side of the road to walk on. Few ideas are as toxic
as ‘me’ and ‘mine’. As soon as they are taken to be ultimate realities, ‘them’
and ‘theirs’ appear, and a whole world of fear and distrust arises. It may seem
ridiculous that a young man should feel so strongly about the correct side of a
quiet lane to walk in ‘his’ country. But it is important to note how prone we
all are to the foolish way of thinking that make such a position seen
reasonable.
