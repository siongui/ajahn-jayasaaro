Every good action has a good result, immediately. A kind action immediately
increases the power of kindness in our heart, and immediately reduces the power
of unkindness. It is one small step to liberation.

Usually however, a good action will only have a good effect on our life in the
world; if those around us value goodness. In some places, for instance, kindness
is seen as weakness. But internally, every single act of goodness, no matter how
small, helps to purify our heart.
