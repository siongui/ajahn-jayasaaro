During the ordination ceremony, a Buddhist monk receives his first meditation
object from his preceptor. He repeats a list of five Pali words forwards and
backwards. These words translate as ‘hair of the head’, ‘hair of the body’,
‘nails’, ‘teeth’ and ‘skin’. The monk is expected to make the reflection on
these five body parts as impermanent, unattractive and impersonal, a daily
practice for the rest of his life.

Being able to perceive hair as just hair, nails as just nails, teeth as just
teeth and skin as just skin is a suprisingly powerful practice. It cuts right
through our instinctual attachment to the body as ‘me’ and ‘mine’. It protects
against all the commercial forces that encourage us to become obsessed with
physical attactiveness.
