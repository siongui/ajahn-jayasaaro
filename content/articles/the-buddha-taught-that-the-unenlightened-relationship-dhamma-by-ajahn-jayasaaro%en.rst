The Buddha taught that the unenlightened relationship to the agreeable aspects
of life such as youth and good health, may be best characterized as a kind of
intoxication. We take the good things in life for granted, forget their
impermanent nature, and as a result, act, speak and think in ways that cause
suffering to ourselves and others.

For this reason the Buddha taught us to constantly remind ourselves:

1. I am subject to old age. I am not exempt from old age
2. I am subject to illness. I am not exempt from illness
3. I am subject to death. I am not exempt from death
4. Sooner or later, I will be separated from everyone and everything dear and
   agreeable to me.
5. I am the owner of my kamma, heir to my kamma; I have kamma as my origin,
   kamma as my relative, kamma as my support. I will be the heir of whatever
   kamma that I do, good or bad

The strength of resistance we feel towards these reflections is a measure of the
strength of the intoxication, it is dwelling on the truth that makes us sober
and clear-minded
