Zhuangzi once told the story of how a rare and beautiful seabird blown off
course by a storm came to earth in the capital of Lu. The Marguis of Lu was so
delighted that he declared the seabird his special guest. He had performers sing
and dance for the bird day and night, and presented it with fine roast meats and
the choicest wines. But the bird was terrified and confused by this kindness. It
ate and drank nothing. After three days it died.

What we think is good for another and will make them happy is not always the
case. In seeking to help others always ask yourself: ‘What assumptions am I
making? What am I taking for granted?’
