2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Luang Por Chah. The 16th
January, Teacher's Day here in Thailand, is the day that we commemorate his
passing away.
Almost 2600 years since the Buddha left the world, Luang Por Chah proved through
his practice of Dhamma that complete liberation from suffering is as possible
today as it was in the time of the Buddha.
Luang Por Chah compared the true nature of all things to underground water.
Anyone who is willing to keep digging down into the earth, without succumbing to
distraction or discouragement, will surely reach the sweet, pure water of truth
and quench their thirst once and for all.
