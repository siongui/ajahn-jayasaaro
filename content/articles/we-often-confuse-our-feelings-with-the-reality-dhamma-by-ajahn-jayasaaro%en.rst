We often confuse our feelings with the reality around us. We say 'this is
boring' when we mean, 'I feel bored.' We say 'this is depressing' when we mean,
'I feel depressed.'

But if a situation were truly boring then everyone would feel bored by it. But
some people are not bored by the situations that we find boring, and some people
even enjoy them. It is important to recognise that our state of mind is not just
the inevitable reflection of the external situation. We have the capacity to
train our minds to the point that we are not conditioned by the situations in
which we find ourselves.
