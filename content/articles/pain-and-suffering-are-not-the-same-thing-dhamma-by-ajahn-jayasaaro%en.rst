Pain and suffering are not the same thing. Mental suffering is only experienced
when there is resistance to pain. But this does not mean, however, that we
should always accept the pain. Although some pain is unavoidable, some is not.
Pain can be a signal that there is a physical problem that needs attending to.
If a task can be accomplished without physical pain, then so much the better.
But if a certain amount of physical discomfort is inevitable in accomplishing a
task, then our effort should be to prevent the symptoms of resistance - anxiety,
fear, anger, and the craving for the pain to go away - from obstructing our
progress.
