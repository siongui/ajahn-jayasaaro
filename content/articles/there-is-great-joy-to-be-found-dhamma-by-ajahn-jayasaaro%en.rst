There is great joy to be found in hearing a profound teaching for the first
time, or in finally understanding a teaching that has always seemed too
difficult to make sense of. But there is a danger here: we can begin to crave
that joy to the extent that we become almost indifferent to fundamental
teachings that we learnt long ago. Now these teachings can seem obvious and
uninteresting. That is why one master spoke of the importance of maintaining ‘a
beginner's mind.’ He meant by this that we should try to approach every teaching
with a mind that is fresh and free of pre-conceived ideas. When we cultivate the
beginner's mind, even teachings such as that actions of body, speech and mind
motivated by goodness have good results, those motivated by defilement have bad
results, can give us feelings of Dhamma bliss.
