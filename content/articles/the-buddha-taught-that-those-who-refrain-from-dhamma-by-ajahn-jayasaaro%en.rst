The Buddha taught that those who refrain from taking life, from taking what is
not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from intoxicants, give
to an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity and affliction. As
a result they in their turn will enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear, enmity
and affliction.

Precepts are not commandments. In Buddhist teachings there is no belief in a
supernatural power who rewards the good and punishes the bad. Refraining from
the five kinds of bad kamma listed above comes naturally to one who
wholeheartedly cultivates wisdom and compassion.
