There are many ways of talking about the functioning - or, more accurately, the
misfunctioning - of the unenlightened mind. For example, we can say that as soon
as the mind grasps onto mental states as ‘me’ or ‘mine’, the mind becomes
‘defiled’ or ‘stained’. Here, the emphasis is on a purity that becomes sullied.
Or we can say that the mind becomes ‘afflicted’ by grasping. Here the emphasis
is on the suffering that ensues. Whatever words we use, the vital thing is that
through seeing the effect of grasping and attachment on the mind we develop a
strong wish to be free of it. Inner liberation only becomes possible when we
gain a profound sense of the ways in which we are unfree, and as a result feel a
great cool sadness. That sadness leads to an unshakeable determination to find a
way out of our self-created prison.
