A new year makes us think of new beginnings. But we can only truly move forward
when we know where we have come from, how we have got to where we are now, and
what destination we hope to reach. This means we need to know how to take a step
back from all our daily activities and spend a little time considering the big
picture of our life. Start the new year with wisdom.

The more short-term are the goals of a person, an economy, a nation, the more
reasonable it seems to focus on material progress. The more long-term the goals,
the more necessary it seems to focus on values. The wise approach is to consider
the two together. Identifying our core values and then pursuing short-term goals
that promote them or, at the very least, do not undermine them, is the way to
sustainable progress both on the individual and social level.

On this Thai New Year Day of 2559 may the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless and
protect all that is good and noble in our hearts, and in this dear country
