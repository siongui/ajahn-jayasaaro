Nothing and nobody has the power to make us angry. There is always a part of us
that wants to be angry, that enjoys it. Anger arises when our unrealistic
expectations of situations and people are frustrated. We want everyone to
respect us and feel angry when we are disrespected. We want the world to be a
fair and kind place to live in, and feel angry to see its unfairness and
cruelty.

The more clearly we understand all the causes and conditions that lead to things
happening the way the way they do, and to people acting the way they do, the
less we will rage that things are not as we want them to be, are not how we
think they should be. From this calm place we can move forward, abandoning what
should be abandoned, developing what should be developed
