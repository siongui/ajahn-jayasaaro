Letting go of memories and imagination, and returning again and again to the
meditation object is a fundamental part of the training of the mind. But how,
exactly, do we let go of the distraction? If we brush it aside roughly and force
the mind back to the object, we often carry with us a sense of unfinished
business. Before long, the mind returns to the distraction. So, as the mind
becomes aware of the distraction, it is better to simply hold it in full
awareness for a moment without aversion, seeing it as a mere thought, and then
letting it go whole-heartedly, without regret. Remind yourself that no matter
how fascinating or enjoyable the thought might be, ultimately it is a dead end.
No passing mental state can lead you to your true goal, which is liberation.
