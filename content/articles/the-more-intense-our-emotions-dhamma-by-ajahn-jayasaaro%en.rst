The more intense our emotions the bigger the difference between time as we
experience it and time as measured by a clock. When we are suffering a single
minute can seem like an hour. When we are happy an hour can seem like a minute.

Many lay Buddhists make merit in order to gain rebirth in a heaven realm. The
life-span of beings in heaven realms is said to be many millions of years long.
But that is clock time. In the experience of a heavenly being it can feel like a
very short time indeed. Seeking rebirth in a heaven realm by doing good deeds is
not wrong exactly, but it is short-sighted. When our time in heaven expires the
real work of abandoning defilements remains. Heaven is just a very pleasant
holiday destination
