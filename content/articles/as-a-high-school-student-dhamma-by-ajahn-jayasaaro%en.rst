As a high school student I was fond of the works of the American Buddhist poet,
Gary Snyder. One short poem, 'Hay for the Horses' affected me strongly. In it an
old man reviews his life:

  | "I'm sixty eight" he said,
  | "I first bucked hay when I was seventeen.
  |  I thought, that day I started,
  |  I sure would hate to do this all my life.
  |  And dammit, that's just what
  |  I've gone and done."

It was one of the saddest things I'd ever read. Reflecting upon it again and
again was, I think, the first step I took towards my eventual decision to spend
my life as a Buddhist monk
