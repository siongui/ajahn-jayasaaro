Ajahn Chah once commented on the reasons he believed people who had high
academic qualifications were often hard to teach. He said it was what happened
when people studied to accumulate knowledge rather than to remove defilement and
ignorance about life itself

  “What they don't realize is that if they have a batchelor's degree, then so do
  their defilements; if they have a master's degree, then their defilements have
  got one too; and if they have a doctorate, their defilements do also.”
