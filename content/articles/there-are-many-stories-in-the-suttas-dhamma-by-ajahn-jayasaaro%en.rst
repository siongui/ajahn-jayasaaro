There are many stories in the Suttas in which Māra, ‘the Evil One’, disguises
himself in various ways in order to deceive the Buddha. But the Buddha is never
fooled. In every case, he merely says, ‘I see you, Māra’ and Māra, disappointed,
disappears.

These stories teach us that it is our ability to see mental defilements clearly
for what they are that is our greatest protection. With mindfulness we say
calmly to ourselves ‘I see you, greed’, ‘I see you, anger’, ‘I see you,
anxiety’. Because these defilements are simply unwelcome guests, not who we are,
having been fully recognised and acknowledged, they retreat.
