Precepts are not commandments. There is no commander. The motive for keeping
precepts is not the desire for rewards or the fear of punishment. Precepts are
objects of mindfulness that must be adopted voluntarily after clearly seeing the
value of doing so. Keeping precepts promotes a safe, trusting environment and an
inner freedom from guilt and remorse.
In daily life, where the grey areas far outnumber the black and white, the
recollection of the precepts gives clear guidelines for action and speech that
cut through our tendency to follow our moods, and to rationalize our
defilements. Keeping precepts keeps us safe from bad kamma and its results.
