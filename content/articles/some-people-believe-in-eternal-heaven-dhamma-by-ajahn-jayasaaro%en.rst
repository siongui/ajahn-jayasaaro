Some people believe in eternal heaven and eternal hell. Some people believe that
the death of the body is the end of everything. Some people believe that it is
better not to think about death and its meaning at all.

The Buddha taught that the more we understand causality, and the more we
understand the nature of our body and mind, the more that beliefs in
annihilation and eternity dissolve. Look closely within and the Middle Way of
the Buddha will slowly emerge.
