Why is it that we so love the feeling of gaining things and making a profit? Why
do we so hate the feeling of losing things or making a loss? Why is it that we
can feel so much pleasure at trivial gains and suffer so badly over unimportant
losses?

It is not the things that we gain or lose that is so important to us as what
gain and loss signify. Deep inside us we believe that gain means life and loss
means death. We feel a gain to be a step away from death, a loss a step closer.
And because we crave life and fear death, we suffer

Through meditation we see how arising is always followed by passing away. Life
and death are revealed as inseparable. The less we perceive ourselves to be the
one to whom life and death occur the more free of them we become, the less
obsessed with gain and loss.
