Once upon a time a young man did a great service for the king. The king gave him
a reward of one hundred gold coins. The young man stuffed the coins into his
pockets and rushed home to his family. When he arrived home he counted the coins
again. Only ninety nine remained. He realized that one of his pockets had a
small hole and a coin had slipped through it. He was so upset about losing that
one gold coin that he forgot to feel happy about the ninety nine coins that he
still possessed.
In the course of performing some good action, we often make a small mistake. We
tend to suffer so much over that small mistake that we forget all the good kamma
we made before and after it.
The wise person analyses the mistake and takes measures to prevent it happening
again. He mends the hole in his pocket and moves on.
