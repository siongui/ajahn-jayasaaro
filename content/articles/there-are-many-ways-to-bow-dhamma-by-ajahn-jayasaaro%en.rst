There are many ways to bow. But for me, the essence of the bow is the contact
between the forehead and the floor. What a wonderful feeling that is! Our sense
of identity is so bound up with our face, and with the acts of seeing, hearing,
touching and smelling, all of which take place in the head. The head is the seat
of the brain. So, bowing with awareness is to bring all that is most meaningful
in our life to the floor, as an expression of humility and devotion. We bow
before a symbol of peace, wisdom, compassion and purity renewing our commitment
to those virtues as our guides through life, and our ultimate goals.
