Having no choices in life is depressing. But having too many can cripple us.
When there are a great many options to choose from, fear of making the wrong
choice, or of not making the very best choice, can mean that we make no choice
at all.

There are so many Buddhist teachings and traditions to choose from these days.
It is wonderful that in the modern world there is such easy access to the
Dhamma. But that easy access brings with it its own dangers. If we can turn on
or turn off Dhamma with the tap of a screen, we risk becoming mere passive
consumers of Dhamma rather than its students. The Dhamma is challenging us to
use the tools it provides to take responsibility for our lives. Choose a path
and learn the Dhamma by committing to that path through the smooth times and the
rough.
