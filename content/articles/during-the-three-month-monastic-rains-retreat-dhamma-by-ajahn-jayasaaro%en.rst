During the three-month monastic Rains Retreat, lay Buddhists often try to be
stricter with their precepts. Success varies.
Three types of response can observed in those that fail, which shows us a lot
about how our minds work when we don't follow up on commitments

a) ‘No I didn't. Not really.’
   We break our vow but refuse to accept that we did so. Usually this involves
   re-defining the vow. For example, we say that in fact the precept does not
   prohibit all consumption of alcohol, only getting drunk

b) ‘Yes I did. But...’
   We break our vow but try to minimise the importance. For example: ‘Well yes I
   did tell a lie but it was only a small one, it wasn't malicious, and being
   too strict with these things is not the Middle Way.

c) ‘Yes I did. And...’
   We break our vow but make a bargain with ourselves in order to feel better
   about it. For example “Well yes, I did break my vow but I'm going to keep it
   even more strictly in the future.

Keeping vows requires us to be aware of how tricky our mind can be. Don't be
fooled by it. If you do break a vow, don't give up. Learn from your mistake and
humbly start again.
