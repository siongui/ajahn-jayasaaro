The Buddha taught that mental suffering is a consequence of mental defilements,
and that no defilement ever goes away by itself, defilements can only be
abandoned through practice of the Eightfold Path. If that is true, then the
sooner we start to practise the Dhamma with sincerity and a sense of urgency,
the better. Sooner or later this work will have to be done. If not today, then
tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. If not the day after
tomorrow, then next week. If not next week, then next month. If not next month,
then next year. If not next year, then in a later year. If not in this life,
then in a future life. As we have no guarantees as to our physical health, our
access to the teachings or even a human birth in the future, it makes sense to
apply ourselves while we are benefiting from supportive conditions. Time is
precious; use it wisely.
