We assume that the ground under our feet is solid like concrete, but in fact we
are always walking on thin ice. There is no true safety and refuge to be found
in the material world. We cannot control the constant changes taking place and
if our happiness is dependent on things being a certain way, we will always be
only a single step from suffering. It is by observing change in all its forms
that we can learn to respond wisely to the challenges that life provides us,
rather than blindly reacting through fear or desire.
