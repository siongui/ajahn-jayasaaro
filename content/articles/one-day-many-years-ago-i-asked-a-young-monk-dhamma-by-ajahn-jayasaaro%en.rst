One day, many years ago, I asked a young monk who was learning Thai how much of
my morning Dhamma talk he had understood. He replied. ‘80-90%’ But when I asked
him to translate into English some of the key concepts of the talk he was unable
to do so. I cautioned him about the dangers facing language learners. At a
certain level of fluency, the temptation is to create meaning by passing over
unknown words and stringing known words together in a plausible sequence. The
fallacy lies in the assumption that the missing words are not vital to the
overall meaning of the passage. Language learners can believe that they have
gained a basic understanding of a matter when, in fact, they have developed a
possibly serious misunderstanding.

In so many situations in life we lack access to all the information we need to
fully understand what is going on. The danger is that we act like the young monk
learning Thai and assume that our interpretation of a matter is essentially
correct, and that what we don't know is not vital to understanding it. A wise
person learns how to hold views and opinions lightly, and to be always ready to
accomodate new information.
