One person expresses disappointment on arriving at a holiday destination reputed
to be ‘unspoilt’ and finding it packed with tourists. Another groans at how much
traffic there is on the road as they return home after work. A third complains
about the long queue at the check-in counter at the airport. In each case the
dissatisfied person perceives themself as separate from everyone else involved.
He or she is the hero or heroine of their story and is being given a hard time.
They forget that they themself are one of the tourists, a part of the traffic,
and one of many people who travel by plane. And so they suffer.

When these kinds of thoughts and feelings arise, gain a new perspective by
imagining yourself through the eyes of a bird - or the lens of a drone - as just
one of many beings, not the centre of the universe.

Changing the perception from ‘me’ to ‘we, all of us together’ can release a
great deal of negativity in the mind.
