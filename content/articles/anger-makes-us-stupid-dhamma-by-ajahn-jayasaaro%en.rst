Anger makes us stupid. Our perception of situations becomes coarse and
distorted. We say and do things we feel bad about afterwards. Being a prey to
anger undermines our self-respect. When angry we can make serious bad kamma. Our
actions and speech not only create long-lasting problems in our relationships
with those around us, but also - if we believe the testimony of the enlightened
ones - have grave consequences for future lives.

Please reflect on all the suffering you have created for yourself and others
through anger, and resolve to free yourself from it. This freedom is not beyond
you to realize, but is only possible through following the Buddha's path of
training. The training involves mindfulness and restraint of conduct and speech,
systematic cultivation of positive mental states such as loving-kindness, and
the investigation and abandonment of the craving and attachments that lie behind
anger.
