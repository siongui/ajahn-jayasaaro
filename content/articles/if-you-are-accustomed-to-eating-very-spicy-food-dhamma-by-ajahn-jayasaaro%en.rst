If you are accustomed to eating very spicy food, food prepared without spices
seems bland and boring. But if you persevere over a certain period of time, the
subtle flavours of such natural food begun to emerge, and the feeling that
something is missing from it disappears.

A quiet mind can at first seem like natural food lacking spice. It provides none
of the excitement and drama given by constant stimulation of the senses. But if
you persevere you will discover a beauty and profundity in the clear, quiet mind
that is truly satisfying.
