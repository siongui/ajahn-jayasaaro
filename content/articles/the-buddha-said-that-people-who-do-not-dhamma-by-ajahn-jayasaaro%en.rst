The Buddha said that people who do not train their minds are like those who live
in a house with holes in the roof. They can get so used to good weather that
they see no point in spending time and effort on repairing the roof. When the
rain comes, it leaks into their house and causes great damage.
The value of training the mind may not be so apparent when everything is going
well in our lives, but it becomes very clear when we are hit by a storm of
difficult experiences. Wise people seek to prepare themselves for all
possibilities. They see the value and dangers in positive thinking. True
security comes with constant practice of the Buddha's path.
