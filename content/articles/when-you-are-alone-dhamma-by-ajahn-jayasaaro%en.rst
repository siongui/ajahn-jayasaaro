When you are alone, one way of increasing mindfulness during daily tasks is to
vary the speed at which you perform them. Making all your movements very
deliberately, almost as if you are moving in slow motion, is a good exercise for
developing awareness of the body, for calming the mind, for being aware of
intention, and all the thoughts and emotions that normally flash through your
mind. At other times it can also be helpful to do things very quickly. Trying to
perform everyday actions such as getting dressed at speed and without mistakes
brings a sharpness and energy into our minds, and a healthy exhilaration.
