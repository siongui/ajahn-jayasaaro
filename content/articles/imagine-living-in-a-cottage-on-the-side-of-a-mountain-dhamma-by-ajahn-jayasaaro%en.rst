Imagine living in a cottage on the side of a mountain. You can hear the sound of
a chainsaw in the forested valley below. It is a very irritating sound, and
because the noise is not even, it is hard to ignore. But after some time you get
more used to it. Minutes pass without you being aware of the sound, but when
your mind is drawn back to it again you realise that your body and mind have
been tense the whole time.

And then the noise stops. It is not an absolute silence. You can still hear the
wind in the trees and the singing of the birds. But those sounds don't disturb
the silence. They seem like part of it.

The cessation of suffering may be understood in this way. Cessation is not
extinction. It is like the end of the sound of the annoying chainsaw. Nature,
the wind, the trees, the birds remain.
