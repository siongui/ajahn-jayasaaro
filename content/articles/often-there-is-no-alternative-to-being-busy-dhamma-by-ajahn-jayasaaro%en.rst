Often there is no alternative to being busy. We have so many responsibilities to
fulfill and time is limited. Nevertheless, we should try to simplify our life
wherever it is possible to do so. Beware of allowing busyness to become an
addiction, so that you are always having to rush onto the next thing. And beware
of using busyness as an excuse for not attending to the more difficult matters
of the heart. You have to spend time with your heart if you want to learn how to
heal it.
