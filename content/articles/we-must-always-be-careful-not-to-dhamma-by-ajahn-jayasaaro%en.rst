We must always be careful not to allow the joy that arises from listening to and
reading the Dhamma to fool us into thinking that we know more than we actually
do. The knowledge that comes from listening and reading is still quite
superficial. It doesn't have the power to uproot the defilements that are so
deeply embedded in our minds.

Ajahn Chā once said that many students of Buddhism are like ants that crawl
around on the outside of a mango, without actually ever tasting the juice inside
it. Having studied the teachings we must learn to apply them in our lives. They
should be looked upon as a map for practice or a recipe. The vital thing is that
we don't just collect teachings but make use of them on the path to liberation.
