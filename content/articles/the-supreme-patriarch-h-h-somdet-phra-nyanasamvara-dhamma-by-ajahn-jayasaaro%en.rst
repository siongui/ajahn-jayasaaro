The Supreme Patriarch, H.H. Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara, constantly encouraged
people to take responsibility for their lives, to recognise that by putting
their faith in the Buddha and by trying to put his teachings into practice,
everyone - monastics and lay Buddhists - can contribute to making Thailand a
better, happier and more peaceful land.

He once wrote

  “A good heart can cool the world down, and an evil heart can set it on fire.
  This is an inarguable truth, and the reason why we must train our own minds,
  and encourage others to train theirs. One heart, the heart of just one person,
  can have a visible effect. One good heart, just one good person, is capable of
  helping people to live together in happiness and peace”

We can honour the Supreme Patriarch by putting his faith in us to the test.
Through our comittment to the Buddha's teachings can we truly make a difference
to our families and communities?
