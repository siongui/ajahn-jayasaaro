Moment by moment we identify with aspects of the body and mind as being self or
belonging to self. We say 'my body', 'my feelings', 'my ideas', 'my hopes', 'my
fears' and so on. But if these things truly belong to us, why do we have so
little power over them? Why, for example, can't we just decide to be less
anxious and more happy? Why can't we forbid our body from getting old? In what
sense does this body and mind belong to us at all?

The Buddha taught us that the false idea of a permanent independent 'me' who is
the owner of experience is the fundamental cause of human suffering. All mental
defilements spring from this one mistake. As meditators we must train to create
the inner strength, stillness and happiness to enable us to see the body and
mind clearly. Then we will discover for ourselves that there is simply a natural
flow of phenomena with no owner to be found. This is the Buddha's path of
liberation.
