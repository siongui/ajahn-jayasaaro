Anger is always likely to arise when our desires are frustrated. Anger easily
overcomes our mind when we want people to be a certain way or act a certain way,
and they show that they are not who we would like them to be, or they don't act
in the ways that we want them to act. Anger is especially likely to arise if the
people involved are important to us, or have the power to affect our lives.
Anger becomes especially strong when we are afraid, or when we think we are
right. ‘I am right. They are wrong.’ is a dangerous thought because it makes
anger seem sensible and correct.
The Buddha taught us to learn to observe the way things change according to
causes and conditions. When we do this we see that we cannot control the world
we live in. Our desires are just one small element of the flow of events. We
don't have to passively accept everything as kamma or fate, but we do need to
stop forming unrealistic expectations of ourselves and others. With a calm mind
we can steadily work towards solving problems by dealing with their supporting
conditions
