As Buddhist we study our humanity. We learn about our body and mind, and how to
prevent them from becoming a source of suffering. Looking at the body we begin
with those parts that can be easily seen: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth and
skin. Are these things truly attractive? Do they really belong to us? Consider
skin for example. People identify with skin a lot. They worry about its texture
and its colour. In Asia women want pale skin; in Europe they want a tan. Huge
sums of money are spent every year on beautifying the skin. But what exactly is
skin? Here are some of my favourite skin facts:

50% of dust in the home is actually dead skin. Globally, skin accounts for about
a billion tons of dust in the atmosphere. The number of bacteria living off each
person's skin is about 1,000,000,000,000.

By examining the objects of desire and attachment more closely, the unrealistic
assumptions on which they are based become clear, and the path to freedom opens
up.
