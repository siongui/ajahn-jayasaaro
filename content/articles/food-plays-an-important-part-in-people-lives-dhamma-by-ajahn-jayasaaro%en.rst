Food plays an important part in peoples lives. Apart from nutrition it also
provides much pleasure. Some people even take photos of the food in front of
them and post them on social media. However, as far as I know, nobody takes
photos of their excrement in the toilet bowl, or invites other people to look at
them. But beautiful, delicious food and ugly, bad-smelling excrement are not too
completely different things. One becomes the other through contact with the
human body. All things that come into contact with this body become soiled by
it. Clean and fresh-smelling clothes and bedding are other examples.
Try to observe and learn from everyday experience. The more rounded and
comprehensive our view of the body, the less likely we are to become foolishly
attached to it.
