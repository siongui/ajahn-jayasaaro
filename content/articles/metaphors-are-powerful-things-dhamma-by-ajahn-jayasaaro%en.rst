Metaphors are powerful things. They are very persuasive. The Buddha's teachings
began with the metaphor of the path, and he used similes and metaphors with
great skill throughout his years of teaching. But metaphors, used by less wise
people can be dangerous. We often forget that metaphors cannot prove the truth
of any proposition: they can only illustrate. When we find a metaphor that
provides a clear picture of an abstract matter that we have been unable to
understand, it feels good. And its here that we need to be especially mindful.
We must remind ourselves that this good feeling is not a sure indication that
the clear picture is an accurate representation of the matter in hand.
