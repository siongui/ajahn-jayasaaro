Teach your mind as you would teach a child: with great patience, intelligence
and love. If a child acts badly or foolishly the good parent doesn't get angry,
doesn't panic or become discouraged. The parent's only concern is the welfare of
the child. Sometimes the parent must be very firm, even though the child becomes
upset, and sometimes more gentle. The more mindful parents are, the better their
parenting skills become. Teach your mind as you would teach a child.
