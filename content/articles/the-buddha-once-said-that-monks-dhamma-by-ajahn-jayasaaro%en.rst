The Buddha once said that monks, like fruits, may be divided into four
categories:

|  Rotten on the outside and rotten on the inside.
|  Rotten on the outside and ripe on the inside.
|  Ripe on the outside and rotten on the inside.
|  Ripe on the outside and ripe on the inside.

This teaching reminds us that when we see a monk whose outward appearance is
inspiring we should not immediately assume that he has a pure mind. He may have,
but he may also be acting in a way he hopes will gain some advantage with lay
Buddhists.

Similarly, we should not take it for granted that a monk whose outward
appearance is uninspiring has an impure mind. He may have, but if he is not
breaking any of his precepts, his unattractive personal habits and manner may
simply be the results of old kamma.

The Buddha said that it is only after observing for a considerable time whether
a monk shows evidence of greed, hatred or delusion in his actions and speech
that we can decide whether it is wise to place our trust in him.
