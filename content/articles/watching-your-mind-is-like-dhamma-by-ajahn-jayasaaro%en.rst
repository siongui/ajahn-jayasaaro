Watching your mind is like watching over a small child. Even when your eyes are
not directly on the child, you are constantly aware of where the child is,
whether it's safe or in danger, whether it's happy or sad. You may be working or
talking or relaxing, but you never forget the child. To begin with you may
sometimes have to rush over to move the child from a dangerous situation. But as
you become more proficient you are able to anticipate its movements and prevent
it from straying into danger. At the beginning you may have to keep picking the
child up and comfort it. But as you become more proficient you can intervene
before the child begins to suffer. It requires a lot of effort to look after a
child well, especially at the beginning. But, if you truly love the child, it
doesn't feel like a burden at all. Quite the opposite.
