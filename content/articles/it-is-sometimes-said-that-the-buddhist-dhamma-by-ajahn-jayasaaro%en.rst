It is sometimes said that the Buddhist teaching of contentment leads to
passivity. If we are content with what we have already, people say, then why
struggle to improve anything? If everybody in a country were content then how
could there be any economic development?

In fact, the teaching of contentment is never separated from teachings on right
effort and diligence. The value of contentment is that it protects our mind from
being consumed by thoughts of jealousy, depression and resentment when we
compare ourselves with others who have more than us, or when we dwell on all the
things that we don't have. Even when conditions are difficult we should try to
be at peace with them, see their good points, during our efforts to improve
them. Then we don't have to wait until we reach our goals some time in the
future before we can be happy.
