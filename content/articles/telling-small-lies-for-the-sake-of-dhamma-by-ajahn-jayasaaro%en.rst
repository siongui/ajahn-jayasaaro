Telling small lies for the sake of getting something we want or in order to
avoid something we don't want, soon creates the need to tell further levels of
lies to protect those that have already been told. The more we repeat a lie the
more real it seems to us, and the more we lose the sense of telling a lie as we
speak it. We begin to believe our own lies, and to feel hurt and angry when they
are challenged. This is a dangerous state of affairs.

Devotion to the truth as we know it may lead to occasional embarrassment, losses
and difficulty. But it gives our words weight and gains us the trust and respect
of those around us. The sense of integrity we feel within our hearts is a true
inner refuge.
